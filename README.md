🐘 INDIAN ECONOMY ANALYSIS: Decoding "Geometry of Growth" 🇮🇳

Most people see the Indian economy as a series of headlines. I wanted to see it through the lens of Data Science. 🚀

Is our growth a simple sprint, or is it a complex, multi-layered marathon? To find out, I built INDIAN ECONOMY ANALYSIS—an interactive Machine Learning web application that deep-dives into 15 years of national data. 💻📊

🔍 What’s under the hood?
I didn't just build charts; I applied the full spectrum of the Data Science lifecycle to understand the "Real" story:

📈 The Predictive Engine: Using Multiple Linear Regression, I modeled the relationship between Inflation, FDI, and GDP Growth. I evaluated the model’s "honesty" using MSE and R² scores to see how much of our growth is structural vs. volatile.

🤖 The Intelligence Layer: I implemented Decision Trees and KNN to classify "High Growth" periods. To ensure accuracy, I used Confusion Matrices to look past the raw percentages.

🧩 Pattern Discovery: By applying K-Means Clustering and PCA, I grouped historical years into socio-economic "zones." This revealed fascinating clusters where Per Capita Income and Literacy Rates move in surprising sync.

🧠 Deep Learning: I integrated a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)—a feedforward neural network—to detect the non-linear "ghosts" in the data that standard models often miss.

💡 The Big Takeaway: Data shows that India's economy is no longer just moving; it’s evolving. The correlation between social fabric (Literacy/Poverty) and economic giants (GDP) is becoming the true driver of our resilience.
A huge thank you to my mentor, B Monica ma'am, for pushing me to look beyond the numbers and find the narrative.

The code is Python. The tool is Streamlit. The story is India. 🇮🇳
